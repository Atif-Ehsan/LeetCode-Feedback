I noticed a mistake in the editorial of Question 979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree. The issue is where the dfs details are given. In the third bullet point it should
be Calculate the number of coins the "right" subtree needs to exchange instead of Calculate the number of coins the "left" subtree needs to exchange.
